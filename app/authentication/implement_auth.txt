Spotify Authentication
---

Spotify provides a Python API through the Spotipy library. Spotipy is a Python client for the Spotify Web API, which allows you to interact with Spotify’s music catalog, manage playlists, and control playback.

To use Spotipy, follow these steps:
	1.	Install the Spotipy library:
You can install it via pip:

pip install spotipy


	2.	Get your Spotify API credentials:
	•	Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
	•	Create a new application, and you’ll get your Client ID and Client Secret.
	3.	Authenticate with the Spotify Web API:
To use the API, you’ll need to authenticate. Here’s an example of how to authenticate using Spotipy:

import spotipy
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

# Set your client ID and client secret
client_id = 'your_client_id'
client_secret = 'your_client_secret'

# Authenticate with Spotify using client credentials flow
client_credentials_manager = SpotifyClientCredentials(client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret)
sp = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=client_credentials_manager)

# Now you can interact with the API
results = sp.search(q='The Weeknd', limit=10)
print(results)

This will authenticate using the client credentials flow, which is suitable for accessing public information (e.g., search, playlists) without requiring user login.

	4.	Explore the API:
Once authenticated, you can start using various endpoints to search for music, get playlists, retrieve track details, etc. Some common actions include:
	•	Search for music:

results = sp.search(q='The Weeknd', limit=10)
print(results)


	•	Get track details:

track = sp.track('track_id')
print(track)


	•	Get album details:

album = sp.album('album_id')
print(album)
