Use Case:
1. go to playlist on Spotify
    - maybe find based on what current playlist
        (Optional) include what song context is selected?
    - get session information?
    - specify from playlist name?
    - specify from playlist URI?
2. wait for input()
    - could be enter key
        - assume start at top of playlist
        - assume start at currently played song on Spotify
            - at the beginning
            OR
            - at the current timestamp the song is paused at
    - could be a command `start-valentine-set-asayoru-cafe`
        - can track specific sets entirely
    - could be a menu
        - GUI
        - terminal text GUI
3. play first song of set

WHILE song is not last song
{
    4. pause at the end of the song once it finishes playing
    5. wait for input()
        6. play next song if there is another song
            - "Press Enter to play next song"
            - only plays next song if line is blank
                - else does nothing and prints error message "command not recognized"
        OR
        7. exit the app if song is last song
            - "Press Enter to exit the app"
        OR
        8. custom input to override
            e.g.
            - `spotpaus` -> pause current song
            - `spotnext` -> skip to next song
            - `spotprev` -> go back to prev song, PAUSED
            - `spotplay` -> play current song (equivalent would be pressing Enter with blank command line)
            - `help` -> display commands
